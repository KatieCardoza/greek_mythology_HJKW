Cronus, King of the Titans and God of Time, was the youngest titan. He was the 
child of Uranus and Gaea. Fearing a prophecy that told of Cronus being 
overthrown by one of his children, Cronus sought to swallow all of his children 
immediately after birth. The following were his first five children:

* Demeter
* Hades
* Hera
* Hestia
* Poseidon

Cronus was successful with in swallowing them, but Rhea, Cronus’s wife, 
saved their sixth and youngest child by stowing him away on the island of 
Crete, feeding Cronus a rock instead. This child, who grew up to overthrow his 
father with the help of his swallowed brothers and sisters, was Zeus. 

Zeus grew and when he came of age, he became a servant for Cronus. Zeus fed 
Cronus a concoction of mustard and wine, which caused Cronus to throw up Zeus’s 
five brothers and sisters. Together, the six gods overthrew Cronus in the war 
between Olympians and Titans.

After the war of Olympians and Titans, Zeus became referred to as the 
*Father of Gods and men* and the king of Olympus. Zeus was the mediator when 
other immortals would come to disagreements. Though he was married to Hera, the 
goddess of Marriage and Birth, Zeus played part in many affairs which produced
many more gods.

Zeus fought with a thunderbolt and the shield Aegis. He came across the weapon 
and shield when they were made by the Elder Cyclops in Tartarus. The Elder 
Cyclops also made the Helmet of Darkness for Hades and a Trident for Poseidon. 
Later, he passed on Aegis to his favored daughter, Athena.
