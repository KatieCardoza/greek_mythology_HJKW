Demeter
=======

Demeter was the goddess of agriculture, fertility, sacred law, and the harvest.
 She is most known for her part in the cycle of the harvest rather than the 
 cycle of life and death. Her daughter, Persephone, was abducted by the god of 
 the Underworld, Hades, and she then fell into a state of despair. Crops stopped
  growing and things started to die in Demeterâ€™s grief over her lost daughter. 
 Zeus stepped in and demanded Hades give Persephone back. Hades relented, but 
 Persephone must return to him for one third of every year. This is why the 
 seasons change; Demeter is sad without her daughter during autumn and winter. 
 When Persephone comes back, spring returns. Demeter was important to humankind
  as she introduced the art of agriculture. In honor of her, man built temples 
  made out of thresh and held festivals. The main festival was called the 
  Eleusinian Mysteries, held every five years.
