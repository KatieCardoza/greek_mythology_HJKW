Hera
====

Hera was one of the six children of Cronus. After being freed by her younger 
brother Zeus, the six gods of Olympus overthrew Cronus. Afterwards, Hera married
Zeus, making her the Queen of Olympus. During their marriage, Zeus participated
in many affairs. As the Goddess of Marriage, this angered Hera which caused 
many arguments between the two. There were even instances of Hera seeking 
revenge for these affairs.

One particular revenge story involved Heracles, otherwise known as Hercules. 
Hera attempted to kill Heracles with two serpents as a baby. To Hera’s surprise
and irritation, Heracles killed the serpents. Later, Hera created a storm to 
drive Heracles off course in one of his adventures, with hope that Heracles 
would die. This too was unsuccessful. 

Zeus, angered by the attempts on his son’s life, punished Hera. She was hanged 
in the clouds by a golden chain with heavy anvils to her feet. Hephaestus, the 
child of Hera and Zeus, attempted to free Hera. He was caught by Zeus, though, 
and was thrown out of Olympus. Hephaestus’s leg was broken by the fall. 

Hera felt jealous outside of her marriage as well. In the story of the Trojan 
war, a mortal man named Paris was asked to choose the most beautiful between 
Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera. After Paris chose Aphrodite, Hera sided with the 
Greeks in the war, and played a part in their victory.
