Athena
======

Athena is the goddess of wisdom and battle strategy. She was the figure soldiers prayed and made sacrifices to when they wanted to win battles. Zeus is her father; it is said that she started as a headache in Zeus' head and sprouted out into the world. That is one story of her birth, and it explains the wisdom aspect of her. Her symbol is an owl, as owls are a symbol of wisdom.
