Demigods
========

Demigods are half-human, half-god beings. When a god and human have a child, the result is a demigod. They usually have a bit of the powerfulness that gods contain, while remaining mortal. Though it was frowned upon for gods to have affairs with humans, they did it quite a bit in Greek Mythology.

Here are some famous demigods in the Greek Mythology world:
Perseus - 
Achilles - 
Heracles - 
Orpheus - 
Jason -
