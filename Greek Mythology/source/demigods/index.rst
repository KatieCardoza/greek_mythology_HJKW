Demigods
========


Demigods are half-human, half-god beings. When a god and human have a child, the
result is a demigod. They usually have a bit of the powerfulness that gods
contain, while remaining mortal. Though it was frowned upon for gods to have
affairs with humans, they did it quite a bit in Greek Mythology. Each demigod is
in danger of whatever tragedies might strike in the mortal world, as well as the
monsters and dangers arise in the immortal world. They each, however, typically
obtain a talent or gift that their godly parent had, so they were more powerful
than regular humans, while still being significantly less than godly. The most
powerful and well-known ones were typically children of the "Big Three,"
particularly Zeus. 

Here are some famous demigods in the Greek Mythology world:
