Poseidon
========

Poseidon is the god of the sea. He is one of the "Big Three" gods, the other being his brothers, Zeus and Hades. The "Big Three" are all the sons of the titan Kronos, and they are seen as the most powerful of the gods. The symbol of Poseidon is a trident, as that is his go-to weapon. He was the creator of horses and sea creatures like dolphins and fish. He had children of all sorts- godly children, demigods, and cyclops to new a few.
