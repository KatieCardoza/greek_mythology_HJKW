Poseidon
========


Poseidon is the god of the sea and earthquakes. He is one of the "Big Three"
gods, the other being his brothers, Zeus and Hades. The "Big Three" are all the
sons of the titan Kronos, and they are seen as the most powerful of the gods.
They were swallowed by their father, got out, and worked together to kill him.

The symbol of Poseidon is a trident, as that is his go-to weapon. He was the
creator of horses and sea creatures, like dolphins and fish. He had children of
all sorts- godly children, demigods, and cyclops to new a few.
