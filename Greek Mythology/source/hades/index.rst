Hades
=====

Hades is the god of the dead and King of the Underworld. He is the oldest male child, brother to Zeus and Poseidon. After defeating their father, Cronus, the three brothers divided their reign. Zeus became god of the skies, Poseidon to the seas, and Hades to the underworld. There, he supervised the realm of the dead. Hades is also known as the god of wealth, as rich minerals are found deep in the earth. Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, became his wife when Hades kidnapped her and brought her to the Underworld. After eating the seeds of the forbidden pomegranate, she was unable to leave the Underworld for one third of each year. This period of time is supposed to represent winter. In the Underworld, one can expect to find Furies, which torture the guilty, and Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the Underworld. Rivers separate the land of the dead from the land of the living. Some of these rivers include: Styx, Lethe, Acheron, Plegethon, and Cocytus. Each of these rivers had a unique function to the progression into the Underworld. In Greece, there is a real river called Acheron because that is the river that transports the dead to the Underworld.
