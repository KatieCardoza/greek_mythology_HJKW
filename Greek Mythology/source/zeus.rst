Zeus, Father of Gods and Men
============================

Cronus, King of the Titans and God of Time, was the youngest titan. He was the child of Uranus and Ge. Fearing a prophecy that told of Cronus being overthrown by one of his children, Cronus sought to swallow all of his children immediately after birth. His first five children were Hades, Poseidon, Demeter, Hera, and Hestia. He was successful with in swallowing them, but Rhea, Cronus’s wife, saved their sixth and youngest child by stowing him away on the island of Crete, feeding Cronus a rock instead. This young, who grew up to overthrow his father with the help of his swallowed brothers and sisters, was Zeus. 

Zeus grew and when he came of age, he became a servant for Cronus. Zeus fed Cronus a concoction of mustard and wine, which caused Cronus to throw up Zeus’s five brothers and sisters. Together, the six gods overthrew Cronus in the war between Olympians and Titans.
After the war of Olympians and Titans, Zeus and became referred to as the “Father of Gods and men” and the king of Olympus. Zeus was the mediator when other immortals would come to disagreements. Though he was married to Hera, the goddess of Marriage and Birth, Zeus played part in many affairs which made about many more gods.

Zeus fought with a thunderbolt and the shield Aegis. He came across the weapon and shield when they were made by the Elder Cyclops in Tartarus. The Elder Cyclops also made the Helmet of Darkness for Hades and a Trident for Poseidon. Later, he passed on his shield to his favored daughter, Athena.
