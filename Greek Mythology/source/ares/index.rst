Ares, God of War
================

Ares is a son of Zeus and Hera. On the battlefield, Ares was an unstoppable 
soldier, rightfully earning him the title God of War. In stories, Ares is the 
embodiment of the violence and the chaos that could be found in war. This was in
 contrast to Athena, who embodies strategy and planning in wartime. Companions 
 of Ares were Deimos and Phobos, who represented terror and fear respectively. 
 Though not a follower, Eris, goddess of discord, accompanied the group in war.

Deimos, Phobos, and Eris were all children of Ares. Their mother was Aphrodite. 
The union between Ares and Aphrodite produced a total of eight children. 
The relationship between Ares and Aphrodite was well know, and this became 
problematic since Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus. Upon learning of 
Aphroditeâ€™s affair, Hephaestus uses a clever device of his own creation to trap 
Ares and Aphrodite naked in a bed. This resulted in the humiliation of Ares and 
Aphrodite. 

Humiliation is a common state for Ares within many stories. For example, in the 
Iliad, it is told that Zeus hates Ares more than anyone else, and Ares was on 
the losing side of the Trojan war, siding with the Trojans.
